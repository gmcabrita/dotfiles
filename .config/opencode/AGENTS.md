- In all interaction and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Code exploration

You run in an environment where ast-grep (`sg`) is available; whenever a search requires syntax aware or structural matching, default to `sg --lang $language -p '<pattern>'` and avoid falling back to text-only tools like `rg` or `grep` unless I explicitly request a plain-text search.

## Code Quality Standards

- Make minimal, surgical changes
- **Follow Unix Philosophy** (see below)
- **Never compromise type safety**: No `any`, no non-null assertion operator (`!`), no type assertions (`as Type`)
- **Make illegal states unrepresentable**: Model domain with ADTs/discriminated unions; parse inputs at boundaries into typed structures; if state can't exist, code can't mishandle it
- **Abstractions**: Consciously constrained, pragmatically parameterised, doggedly documented

### Unix Philosophy

1. **Modularity:** Simple parts, clean interfaces
2. **Clarity:** Clarity > cleverness
3. **Composition:** Design programs to connect to other programs
4. **Separation:** Policy from mechanism; interfaces from engines
5. **Simplicity:** Add complexity only where you must
6. **Parsimony:** Big program only when nothing else will do
7. **Transparency:** Design for visibility; make inspection/debugging easy
8. **Robustness:** Child of transparency + simplicity
9. **Representation:** Fold knowledge into data; keep logic stupid
10. **Least Surprise:** In interfaces, do the expected thing
11. **Silence:** Nothing surprising to say → say nothing
12. **Repair:** Fail loud, fail fast
13. **Economy:** Programmer time > machine time
14. **Generation:** Write programs to write programs
15. **Optimization:** Get it working before optimizing
16. **Diversity:** Distrust "one true way"
17. **Extensibility:** Design for the future

## Testing

- Write tests that verify semantically correct behavior
- **Failing tests are acceptable** when they expose genuine bugs and test correct behavior

## SCM, Git, Pull Requests, Commits

- **ALWAYS check for `.jj/` dir before ANY VCS command** - if present, use jj not git
- **Never** add Claude to attribution or as a contributor PRs, commits, messages, or PR descriptions
- **gh CLI available** for GitHub operations (PRs, issues, etc.)

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
