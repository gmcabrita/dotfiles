description: Start Ralph coding loop
---

Start Ralph to complete features from a PRD file.

Ralph runs in the current session, continuing until all features pass or max iterations.

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE FEATURE PER ITERATION.

Workflow per iteration:

1. Find highest-priority incomplete feature (YOU decide priority, not necessarily first in list)
2. Implement it
3. Run format, lint, typecheck + tests
4. Update PRD with work done
5. APPEND progress to progress.txt (leave note for next person working in codebase - do NOT overwrite)
6. Make a commit (git/jj auto-detected)
7. Continue or output `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`

Usage: /ralph @path/to/prd.json [max-iterations]

Arguments:

- prd.json path (required) - use @ to reference file
- max-iterations (optional, default: 25)

Control:

- /ralph-status - check progress
- /ralph-stop - stop after current iteration

State persisted to `.opencode/state/ralph.json`.
Retries up to 3 errors per loop before stopping.
